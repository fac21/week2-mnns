# Project Timeline 

1.  1 hr discussion:
- What's an API anyway?
- Came up with a couple of ideas (karaoke kitchen) 
- Explored a few APIs that we liked
- Made a decision based on that: to do Karaoke Kitchen (have song options and recipe options based on cuisine type) using musixmatch and recipe puppy
- Created User stories

(- I can search for top tracks/recipe of country of my favourite cuisine
- See an interesting mashup of data: Work out a layout of how to display the info
Ideas: Display for Recipes: Img of Food/Link to Recipe (TItle)
Display for Lyrics: Top Tracks, image of Cover, link to lyrics)

2. 1 hr Working on Musixmatch and Recipe Puppy API
- Ran into problems 
# Errors Errors Errors 
- Nafisa and Neville faced errors CORS: Refused to execute http://127.0.0.1:5500/script as script because "X-Content-Type: nosniff" was given and its Content-Type is not a script MIME type.
- Saki and Maryam faced different error messages: No 'access-control-allow-origin' header is present on the requested resource
